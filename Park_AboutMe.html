			  		<p>I am currently a Dublin High school student. My goal is 
			  		to have a successful career in Computer Sceince or in 
			  		Engineering. Taking these PLTW classes in Dublin High will 
			  		hopefully help me with a College with a good technology 
			  		course. This is a path that I wanted to take because I've 
			  		already had an interest in Computers and Designing 
			  		things.</p>
			  		<p>One advantage that I have to coding is that I can use 
			  		HTML and CSS. I can use these programs to code websites, 
			  		such as this site. I'm learning lots of new coding 
			  		languages with the Computer Science course. One thing that 
			  		Computer Science has taught me is that I need to be able to
			  		communicate with my colleagues, which is another skill that
			  		I have. I am a very friendly person who can talk to other
			  		people.</p>
