			  		<p>I am currently a Dublin High school student. My goal is 
			  		to have a successful career in Computer Sceince or in 
			  		Engineering. Taking these Project Lead The Way(PLTW) classes
			  		in Dublin High will 
			  		hopefully help me with a College with a good technology 
			  		course. This is a path that I wanted to take because I've 
			  		already had an interest in Computers and Designing 
			  		things.</p>
			  		<p>One language that I have learned to apply is HTML and 
			  		CSS. I can use these programs to code websites, 
			  		such as this site. I'm learning many coding 
			  		languages with the Computer Science course. One thing that 
			  		Computer Science has taught me is that I need to be able to
			  		communicate with my colleagues, which is another skill that
			  		I have. I am a very friendly person who can talk to other
			  		people. This helps me when I work with a team, and I can 
			  		apply these tactics with job interviews. I'm a team player 
			  		and I posess some leadership skills to lead a team. </p>
			  		<p>In conclusion my goal is to have a job involving Comupter
			  		science or engineering. I know I can have a successful 
			  		because I'm a quick learner and I'm a very friendly person
			  		who loves making new friends with team projects.</p>
