				<h3>App Inventor Project</h3>
				<h4>September 2018</h4>
				<p>This project was longer than the Scratch Project, using similar 
				block software, but for Phone Apps instead of computer programs. 
				This project was done with Abhishek Sarepaka and we spent most of 
				this project together brainstorming and coding together. The game 
				is a simple high score game, the goal being to get as many 
				baskets as possible. If you touch one of the rotten bananas,
				you would lose a point.</p>
				<p>We wanted this game to have a similar feel to a game that focuses
				on getting a good high score within a certain time period. A feature 
				that I am especially proud of is the WebDB, so people can compare 
				high scores with other people across the world. The game was common,
				but the storyline is unique, similar to the Scratch project. </p>
				<p>During the making of the game, there was a big problem that 
				both me and Abhi faced. After coding the high score, the game 
				wouldn't run! It was stuck and we would get an error code! It 
				turns out that we used mathematical statements instead of normal
				statements. It was very stressful but I learned a valuable lesson
				about comupter science. I can use this in the future to make better 
				projects. </p>

				<h3>Text Adventure Project</h3>
				<h4></h4>
				<p>This project was more challanging than the other projects 
				because we were not dealing with blocks anymore. We were working
				on python for the first time, and it was something new. I worked 
				on this project with Ryan Leung. The goal of the game is to 
				answer all of the questions correctly to win. Answering all of
				the questions gets you to the end. This game also has a easter
				egg section full of modern references for a comedic effect.</p>
				<p>During the project, I was responsible for thinking up the 
				questions and I was also responsible for the flow chart that 
				shows the answers and each path. Since the code was extremely
				repetitive, I went and typed some of the code. </p>
				<p>One challange that we faced as the group was a good way to 
				organize the code. It was challanging to get the code to look
				professional. But in the end we managed a good way to get the 
				project to look like it was done by professionals. </p>
