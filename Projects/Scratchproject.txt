				<h3>Scratch Project</h3>
				<h4>August 2018</h4>
				<p>This project was finished in a 2 week time period. It is a game 
				using the scratch coding language, a easy to use block style coding.
				This game used a lot of illustrations, which was done by my partner
				Maggie Pond. I focused primarily about the code and I tried to keep
				the standard WASD format and incorporated some shooting which was a 
				little challenging. </p>
				<p>We wanted to do a game that was somewhat unique compared to 
				other games, although the basic idea is similar to other ideas, 
				the plot is unique compared to other games, which was something that 
				we took pride in. </p>
