				<h3>App Inventor Project</h3>
				<h4>September 2018</h4>
				<p>This project was longer than the Scratch Project, using similar 
				block software, but for Phone Apps instead of computer programs. 
				This project was done with Abhishek Sarepaka and we spent most of 
				this project together brainstorming and coding together.</p>
				<p>We wanted this game to have a similar feel to a game that focuses
				on getting a good high score within a certain time period. A feature 
				that I am especially proud of is the WebDB, so people can compare 
				high scores with other people across the world. The game was common,
				but the storyline is unique, similar to the Scratch project. </p>

				<h3>Scratch Project</h3>
				<h4>August 2018</h4>
				<p>This project was finished in a 2 week time period. It is a game 
				using the scratch coding language, a easy to use block style coding.
				This game used a lot of illustrations, which was done by my partner
				Maggie Pond. I focused primarily about the code and I tried to keep
				the standard WASD format and incorporated some shooting which was a 
				little challenging. </p>
				<p>We wanted to do a game that was somewhat unique compared to 
				other games, although the basic idea is similar to other ideas, 
				the plot is unique compared to other games, which was something that 
				we took pride in. </p>
